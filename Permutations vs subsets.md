If the order is important, then it's asking about permutations.  Otherwise, subsets. 

Subsets: 10 choose 4
Permutation: P(10,4)

1. Formula for Permutations without repetition: P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
2. Permutations with repetition: 

	#### Formula:

	n! / k1! * k2! * k3! (factorials of repeated items)

3. Formula for combinations: n! / r!(n-r)!
