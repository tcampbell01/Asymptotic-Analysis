==Discrete probability== is concerned with experiments in which the sample space is a finite or countably infinite set. Almost all of the experiments analyzed in this material have finite sample spaces. A set is ==countably infinite if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the set and the integers.== An infinite set that is not countably infinite is uncountably infinite. A formal discussion of the different kinds of infinity is beyond the scope of this material, but the following examples give an intuitive feel for the difference between countably infinite and uncountably infinite sets.

The probability distribution in which every outcome has the same probability is called the uniform distribution.

P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - p(A interset B)
