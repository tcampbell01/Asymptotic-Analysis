          "content": "To extend lines farther in draw.io, you can adjust the length of the lines by dragging their endpoints. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Select the Line**: Click on the line you want to extend. You should see small handles (usually small squares) at each end of the line.\n\n2. **Drag the Endpoint**: Click and hold one of the endpoint handles, then drag it to the desired length or position. This will extend the line in the direction you drag.\n\n3. **Adjust the Line**: If you need to adjust the angle or direction of the line, you can also drag the line itself or the other endpoint.\n\nIf you want to extend the line to connect to another shape or element:\n\n1. **Select the Line**: Click on the line to select it.\n\n2. **Drag the Endpoint to the Shape**: Click and drag the endpoint of the line to the edge of the shape you want to connect it to. The line will automatically snap to the connection points on the shape.\n\n3. **Release the Mouse Button**: Once the line is at the desired length and position, release the mouse button to set it in place.\n\nThese steps should help you extend lines in draw.io to fit your diagram's needs.",
