The formula for "**n choose r**" â€” C(n,r) = 

n! / r!(n-r)!

**Fundamental Principles of Counting**

To order 4 people in any order, you would get 4! Because the first seat has 4 choices, the second has 3 choices, the third has 2 choices and the last has 1 choice. 

**Counting Permutations with Repetitions**

n! / k1! * k2! * k3! .... 

Where n! = total permutations if all items were distinct
k1! * k2! * k3! ... factorials of the counts of each group of identical items 

PEPPER: 
6! / 3! * 2! * 1! 

6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 / 12 

HAPPY: 
5!/ 2!
